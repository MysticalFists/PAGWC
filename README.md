Planetary Annihilation Galactic War Cheats

Howdy,

This is my official mod for Planetary Annihilation. I only play AI Skirmish and Galactic War; however, I noticed a severe lack of cheating options for the Galactic War single player campaign. Even the DevMode options hadn't worked in Galactic War mode when I started this. Due to that, I have created an EXTREMELY overpowered hack for Galactic War.

Note: This mod affects gw_dealer.js!! This is very important since this will likely break any existing mods you may be using for modded Cards and Loadouts!

How It Works:
This mod adds a tech card called MysticalFists Tech. The mod works by adding one new tech card with a very high drop rate to ensure you receive it as soon as possible, while ensuring the AI does NOT receive the benefit. The mod/tech has the following benefits:
Mods Move Speed for most (if not all) units including your commander.
Mods Energy/Metal Production/Storage of many units (Infinite Resources).
Mods Build Time for most (if not all) units (Instant Build).
Mods Health for most (if not all) units (Double Health).
Gives access to (most if not all) units/tech.

With this mod activated I am able to receive access to almost all technology from the first move with instant build times and infinite resources. You can actually win a battle within about a minute even during boss encounters. Just be sure to note that if you have any allied AI, they will also receive these benefits, which can be troublesome if they decide to blow up a planet you're standing on.
